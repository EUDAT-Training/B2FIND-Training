# Configuration an OAI harvester
This document describes how to configure your own OAI-PMH harvester based on a joai installation.

## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites
### 1. joai software is installed and running in an Apache Tomcat.
See 00-install-jOAI.md for details.
### 2. Admin account
If you start the provider set up you are prompted to login as user *admin*. By default the password is set as well to *admin*.
<!-- Is this true ??
Describe how to change the password !!!
--> 

## Configuration
### 1. Configuration and customization
Open the GUI of joai at ```sh http://localhost/oai ``` and
go in the menue `Harvester` to `Setup and Status` and click there on `Add new harvest` . In the interface opened, fill out the text fields :

Most of the fields are self-explanatory. 
<!-- Is this true ??? Or add some further help here ... ??? -->

The successful configuration will result in a new `Harvest Repository` :

### 2. Perform harvesting

To trigger now a new harvest you just click on the button `All` in the column `Manually Harvest`.

You can monitor now the harvest progress by clicking on `view the harvest status report for this harvest` and - if all run successfully - you get something like

Now the harvested files should be stored in the above given directory.

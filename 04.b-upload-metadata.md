# Uploading metadata to the metadata catalogue (CKAN portal)
This document describes how to upload 


## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites

### 1. Spreadsheet template
For this part you can document in the tab **Mapping V n.m (YYMMDD)** in the excel spreadsheet **Community-B2FIND_mapping.template.xlsx** in the columns examples how the metadata are represented in the original community poratl (as far it exists) and in your (or the B2FIND) portal. Typically at this stage a version for your community is created with the tabs **Hartvest** and **Mapping** already filled out (by the B2FIND team and/or the community/project). 

Please open the excel sheet with an appropriate office program.

### 2. The uploader software
For uploading we use again the python script ```sh mdmanger.py```, this time in the mode ```sh‘u’```. 

### 3. Some JSON samples
The uploader process expects that CKAN compatible and validated (see module ...) files are available in the directory ```sh oaidata/<Project-name>/json```.

### 4. CKAN manager account

## The Mapping process

### 1. The uploading process

#### 1.a. Create a CKAN group for your project/community  
To upload metadata for your project <ProjectName> we create a correspending group in your CKAN instance (i.e. community in the B2FIND case), to group all metadata of teh project under one umbrella.

To do this you have to login as CKAN admin in the CKAN website ...

Then go to 'Groups' and 'Add group' ... etc. pp. ...
Group name must be the same <ProjectName> you gave to the oaidata sub directory and to the -c option below ...
...

 
#### 2. The uploading of the JSON files is executed by :
Let <YourCKAN-IP> be the URL of the CKAN instance you want to upload :

´´´sh
./mdmanager.py --mode u -c <ProjectName> -i <YourCKAN-IP>
´´´

But this will only work if you have write permissions to <YourCKAN-IP>, i.e.
you need th appopriate API-key.
You get this by clicking on 'Admin??' while logged in as admin in the CKAN GUI.
On the left below corner the API-key is shown. Copy it to your clipboard and call the above command with ```sh --auth <API-Key> or add a line 
´´´sh
<YourCKAN-IP>  <API-Key>
´´´
to the file ```sh ~/.netrc```.

....

#### 3. Check the uploaded file
If all worked fine you should now see the uploaded datasets under the group <ProjectName> in the CKAN website.

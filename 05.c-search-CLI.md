# Search via the Command Line Interface
This document describes the usage of the command line script *searchB2FIND.py*.

## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites

### 1. The Pyton script
```sh
./searchB2FIND.py -h
```

### 2. Python ckanclient
Here we use the Python client *ckanclient 0.10* for the CKAN API.
This comes already installed with this training package.

(For usage in another environement you can install it by
```sh
pip install ckanclient
```
or download the package from *https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ckanclient* .
)

## Usage

### 1. Usage, help and syntax

Start please by checking the help
```sh
./searchB2FIND.py -h
usage: searchB2FIND.py [-h] [--ckan IP/URL] [--output STRING]
                       [--community STRING] [--keys [KEYS [KEYS ...]]]
                       [PATTERN [PATTERN ...]]

Description: Lists identifers of datasets that fulfill the given search criteria

positional arguments:
  PATTERN               CKAN search pattern, i.e. by logical conjunctions
                        joined field:value terms.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ckan IP/URL         CKAN portal address, to which search requests are
                        submitted (default is b2find.eudat.eu)
  --output STRING, -o STRING
                        Output file name and format. Format is determined by
                        the extention, supported are 'txt' (plain ascii file)
                        or 'hd5' file. Default is the ascii file results.txt.
  --community STRING, -c STRING
                        Community where you want to search in
  --keys [KEYS [KEYS ...]], -k [KEYS [KEYS ...]]
                        Keys to be outputed for the found records. Default is
                        to print out only the B2FIND identifier . If you want
                        only know the total numbers of records found, but no
                        id's should be listed, enter None. Additionally
                        supported fields are all fields of the B2FIND schema
                        and some additional admin properties. If you want
                        statistical information about all B2FIND fields enter
                        'B2FIND.*'

Examples:
           1. >./searchB2FIND.py -c aleph tags:LEP
             searchs for all datasets of community ALEPH with tag "LEP" in b2find.eudat.eu.
           2. >./searchB2FIND.py author:"Jones*" AND Discipline:"Crystal?Structure" --ckan eudat-b1.dkrz.de
             searchs in eudat-b1.dkrz.de for all datasets having an author starting with "Jones" and belongs to the discipline "Crystal Structure"
           3. >./searchB2FIND.py -c narcis DOI:'*' --keys DOI
             returns the list of id's and DOI's for all records in community "NARCIS" that have a DOI
```

#### Example 1 : List communities integrated in B2FIND

By submitting the command
```sh
./searchB2FIND.py --keys Community

#### Example 2 : Free text search



#### Example 3 : Geospatial search 
If you want to search for all datasets, which have an overlap with the a region covering (the main part of) theEuropean continent, use the facet *ext_bbox* and the according latitudes and longitudes of the box :

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=&ext_bbox=-20.390625%2C30.751277776257812%2C45%2C60.930432202923335

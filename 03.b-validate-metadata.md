This document describes how to validate mapped metadata formated in B2FIND schema (or any other schema). 

## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites

### 1. Spreadsheet template
For this part we use as well the tab **Mapping V n.m (YYMMDD)** in the excel spreadsheet **Community-B2FIND_mapping.template.xlsx** has to be filled out. Typically at this stage already a version for your community or project is created. 

Please open the excel sheet with an appropriate office program.

### 2. The software
For validation we use again the python script ```sh mdmanger.py```, but this time with the mode ‘v’. 

### 3. Some JSON samples
The validation execution expects that some mapped JSON files to check resides in the directory ```sh oaidata/<Project-name>/json```.


## The Validation process

Validition is executed by using the option ```sh –v``` and creates a file, which contains statistical information. 

```sh
./mdmanager.py --mode v –c <ProjectName>  
less oaidata/<ProjectName>-oai_dc/mdsubset/validation.stat
```

# Validation of Metadata
This document describes how to validate mapped metadata formatted in the B2FIND schema (or any other schema). 

## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

## Prerequisites

### 1. The script mdmanager.py
The python script `mdmanager.py` is used in `mode ‘v’` for this training module, just as it was in the previous modules, see [this module](00-mdmanager-script.md) for more information about the scrtipt.

### 2. Spreadsheet template
In this section we also use the **Mapping V n.m (YYMMDD)** tab of the **Community-B2FIND.template.xlsx** spreadsheet. Typically, a version of this spreadsheet should already be created for your community or project by this stage (see [section 01.a](01.a-specify-metadata.md)). 

This is, however, not necessarily needed for this training.

### 3. The map files
We use the the same configuration files, named like `<community>-<mdformat>.xml`, that were already used in the previous [module 03.a](03.a-map-metadata.md).  

### 4. Some JSON samples
The validation script expects some mapped JSON files that need to be checked to reside in the directory `oaidata/<projectname>/<subset>/json`. If the corresponding mapping has been successfully excecuted in section [03.a](03.a-map-metadata.md), these files will be available.

## The Validation process
Validition is executed using the option `--mode v`. Apart from this, the rest of the options are the same as those used for the making the mapping in the previous section. See the example below. 

```sh
./mdmanager.py --mode v -c fishproject -s http://localhost:8181/oai/provider --mdsubset sample_1 --mdprefix oai_dc
Version:  	2.0
Run mode:   	Validating

The file `validation.stat` contains statistical information about the coverage of the B2FIND fields.

 |-> Facet name       <-- XPATH                
  |- Mapped     | Validated | 
  |--     # |    % |     # |    % |
      | Value statistics:
      |- #Occ  : Value                          |
 ----------------------------------------------------------

 |-> title            <--       //dc:title/text()

  |--     8 |  100 |     8 |  100
      |- 1     : Haplochromis compressiceps          |
      |- 1     : Cyphotilapia frontosus              |
      |- 1     : Neolamprologus brichardi            |
      |- 1     : Lamprologus tretocephalus           |
      |- 1     : Neolamprologus multifasciatus       |
      |- 1     : Neolamprologus cylindricus          |
      |- 1     : Julidochromis ornatus               |
      |- 1     : Julidochromis regani                |
|-> notes            <--       string-join(distinct-values(//dc:description/text()), '\n')

  |--     0 |    0 |     0 |    0

.....
```

I.e. in this case the coverage of the facet *title* is 100 percent, or - in other words - to all eight datasets a `title` is assigned. Furthermore the used XPATH mapping rule is shown, here `dc:title`.

For the facet `notes` (*Description*) we have the reverse case: For none of the eight datasets can a value be assigned.

**Excercise** 
Analyse why `notes` is not properly mapped and update the mapfiles for generation (`mapfiles/fishproject-oai_dc.csv`) and mapping (`mapfiles/fishproject-oai_dc.xml`) such that a successful mapping of this facet can also be achieved.

The ouput of the validation file is used to fill the column *E* (`XPATH mapping rule`) and column *G* (`Coverage (% of mapped datasets [in ...`).

**Excercise** 
Perform the validation for the metadata harvested from the `DataCite` as well. 
> Note : If you successfully performed the last few modules

> the mapped JSON files produced in the directory `oaidata/datacite-oai_dc/ANDS.CENTRE-1/json/` can be used. If these files are not available for any reason, copy the JSON files from the samples path, as follows :
```sh
cp samples/DC_examples/ANDS.CENTRE/json/*.json oaidata/datacite-oai_dc/ANDS.CENTRE-1/json/
```

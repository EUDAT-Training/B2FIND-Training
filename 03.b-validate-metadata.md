# Validation of Metadata
This document describes how to validate mapped metadata formated in B2FIND schema (or any other schema). 

## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites

### 1. The script mdmanager.py
The python script ```mdmanager.py (mode ‘v’)``` is used for this training module and comes already with the training package.

### 2. Spreadsheet template
For this part we use as well the tab **Mapping V n.m (YYMMDD)** in the excel spreadsheet **Community-B2FIND_mapping.template.xlsx**. Typically at this stage already a version for your community or project is created. 

However for this training it is not necessarily needed.

### 3. The map files
These are teh same configuration files ```<community>-<mdformat>.xml``` used already in the previous module [03.a Mapping](03.a-map-metadata.md).  

### 4. Some JSON samples
The validation execution expects that some mapped JSON files to check resides in the directory `oaidata/<projectname>/<subset>/json`. This is the case if the associated mapping in [03.a Mapping](03.a-map-metadata.md) has been successfully excecuted.

## The Validation process

Validition is executed by using the option `--mdoe v` - apart from that the same options as used for the mapping. 

```sh
./mdmanager.py --mode v -c fishproject -s http://localhost:8181/oai/provider --mdsubset sample_1 --mdprefix oai_dc

The file `validation.stat` contains statistical information about the coverage of the B2FIND fields.

      |- 1     : Haplochromis compressiceps          |
      |- 1     : Cyphotilapia frontosus              |
      |- 1     : Neolamprologus brichardi            |
      |- 1     : Lamprologus tretocephalus           |
      |- 1     : Neolamprologus multifasciatus       |
      |- 1     : Neolamprologus cylindricus          |
      |- 1     : Julidochromis ornatus               |
      |- 1     : Julidochromis regani                |
|-> notes            <--       string-join(distinct-values(//dc:description/text()), '\n')

  |--     0 |    0 |     0 |    0

.....
```

I.e. in this case the coverage of the facet *title* is 100 percent, or - in other words - to all eight datasets a `title` is assigned. Furthermore the used XPATH mapping rule is shown, here `dc:title`.

For the facet `notes` (*Description*) we have the reverse case : For none of the eight datasets a value can be assigned.

**Excercise** 
Analyse why `notes` is not properly mapped and update the mapfiles fo generation (`mapfiles/fishproject-oai_dc.csv`) and mapping (`mapfiles/fishproject-oai_dc.xml`) to achieve as well a mapping of this facet. 

The ouput of the validation file is used to fill the column *E* (`XPATH mapping rule`) and column *G* (`Coverage (% of mapped datasets [in ...`).

**Excercise** 
Perform the validation as well for the metadata harvested from the `DataCite` 
> Note : If you successfully performed the last the previous modules 
> (harvest and mapping procedure) for the community `datacite`, 
> the mapped JSON files produced in the directory `oaidata/datacite-oai_dc/ANDS.CENTRE-1/json/` can be used. If these files are not available for some resons copy JSON files from the samples path, as follows :
```sh
cp samples/DC_examples/ANDS.CENTRE/*.json oaidata/datacite-oai_dc/ANDS.CENTRE-1/json/
```

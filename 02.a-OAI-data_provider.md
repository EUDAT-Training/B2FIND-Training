# Configuration of an OAI Data Provider
This document describes how to configure your own OAI-PMH data provider based on a 
jOAI installation. 

##Prerequisites
1. [Installation of the jOAI software](02-install-jOAI.md) running in an Apache Tomcat.
2. Admin account : If you start the first time the `Data Provider` setup you are prompted to login as user *admin*. By default the password is set as well to *admin*. Furthermore you can restrict access to your server or to parts of the stored data as described in section [Repository security](02-install-jOAI.md#reposSecurity) 
3. XML files in OAI metadata format : If you followed the module [01 Generate metadata](01.b-generate-metadata.md) at least for the project *fishproject* should be some DublinCore XML files available. Furthermore we provide you with some example files in the correct format in sub directories of `samples/DC_examples/`.

## Configuration and Customization
How XML files can be indexed for harvesting is here explained with the generated DublinCore XML files for the *fishproject*(see [01. Generation of metadata](01.b-generate-metadata.md)). But of course it works with any other XML files, as far they are formatted in a valid metadata schema.

Open the GUI of joai at `http://<fqdn or ip>/oai` and go to `Data Provider` and `Metadata Files Configuration` and fill out the text fields:

<img align="centre" src="img/jOAI_AddMDDirectory_fishproject.png" width="800px">

* Nickname for these files : Just a label, that describes the content of your metadata ...
* Format of files : The metadata format for the files. We choose `oai_dc`, the OAI abbrevation for *Dublin Core*.
* Path to the directory : Please choose the path to the XML files which should be indexed for harvesting in your OAI provider. 
 * Metadata schema: The URL of the associated MD schema (thsi is automatically filled out, because `oai_dc` is a by OAI supported metadata format.

If you press `Save` and afterwards `Index` you get as result :

## Checks
You can check your data provider and the entries you offer for harvesting here:
http://\<ip address, fully qualified domain name or localhost\>:8181/oai/provider?verb=ListIdentifiers&metadataPrefix=oai_dc

Add a metadata directory for the XML files of the project *seisnet*. (If you succesfully generated the associated XML files in [01.b Generate MD for seisnet](01.b-generate-metadata.md#Excercise2.3) the XML files reside in `oaidata/seisnet-oai_dc/locations_1/xml/`. If not, you can as well the files in `samples/DC_examples/seisnet/xml` already coming with the training material.

In the following figure its examplary shown shown how teh fields should be filled out :
<img align="centre" src="img/jOAI_AddMDDirectory_seisnet.png" width="800px">

In our case this leads to only partly successfully indexed files :

## Validation
If some of the XML records could not be validated this is assigned in the column 'Indexing failed', as shown above for the project *seisnet*, see [Excercise 1](#Excercise1). 

You can now click on the number of the faulty records and then on 'Validate XML record'. But in most cases the error messages are quiet sparse.

You get more detailed information if you check your XML files by a XML validator as e.g. `http://www.xmlvalidation.com`.

Validate the errornous files and try to find out and correct the bugs.

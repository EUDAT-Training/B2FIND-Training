# Data Access 
This document describes how to access data object using the references in the metadata

##Prerequisites

### 1. Internet browser
with Java Script enabled. Supported and tested are

1. Firefox, version later than 45.x.y
2. Google Chrome, version later than 51.x.y

### 2. CKAN instance
We only describe here the usage of the data access identifiers given in [B2FIND portal] (http://b2find.eudat.eu).

## Usage

### 1. Usage of the references in B2FIND
We will demonstrate the ability to access data collections refered to by metadata, which are published in [B2FIND](http://b2find.eudat.eu)
( In case you use your own CKAN installation or the [CKAN demo](http://demo.ckan.org/) by default only the URL given by the CKAN field *Source* will be availbale).

When you open any dataset in the B2FIND portal at least one of the identifiers listed in the table below is available.

| Facet name | Type | Persistent | Resolvable | Citable |
|------------|------|------------|------------|---------|
| Source     | URL  | No         | ?          | No      |
| PID     | Persistent Identifier  | Yes         | Yes   | No |
| DOI     | Digital Object Identifier  | Yes         | Yes   | Yes |

While the *Source* is linked directly to the *data resource*, it is not guranteed that it resolves realy to the associated digital data object.
If a *PID* is given, it is ashured that the link can be resolved, i.e. lead you to the data object. The resolvement is done by handle servers.
A *DOI* heritates these properties, but additionaly it is mainly used to equip the related data object with a 'citation'. Therefore DOI's are often not directly redirected to the underlying resource, but link to a landing page, e.g. a journal or a website of an institution, which are responibsle for the citation. 

This is shown in the following figure :

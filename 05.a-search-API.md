# The Search Application Programming Interface (API)
This document describes how you can interact with a CKAN site by submitting HTTP requests using the CKAN API, on which as well the B2FIND API is based on. For details see the [API guide of CKAN] (http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/index.html). 

##Prerequisites

### 1. Internet browser

Supported and tested are

1. Firefox, version later than 45.x.y
2. Google Chrome, version later than 51.x.y

### 2. CKAN instance 
Your own CKAN installation (see module *04-install-CKAN.md*) or access to the [B2FIND portal] (http://b2find.eudat.eu) (we are open !). Please reset in the following the variable <CKAN_URL> with the URL of the used CKAN site.

## Usage

### 1. Usage of the B2FIND API

You can use *CKANâ€™s Action API*, version 3, directly where a request has the following form 
```sh
http://<CKAN_URL>/api/3/action/<function>[?q=[&<facet>=]<value>]
```
with the partly optional parameters:
 
- <CKAN_URL> is the URL of the CKAN site used, e.g. b2find.eudat.eu,
- <function> is one of the API functions as `group_list` etc. ,
- <facet> is a field of the used schema (in case of B2FIND the B2FIND schema, see ...) and
- <value> is the corresponding value searched for 

If the query did not encounter an error, a submission returns as response a JSON dictionary with three keys:

- "help": the documentation string for the function you called.
- "success": true or false.
- "result": the returned result from the function you called, i.e. a list of (dictioanries describing) the records fulfilling the search criteria.

You can enter these http requests directly in the address field of your browser or submit it from command line with the command `curl`.

We illustrate this with the following 'search use cases', i.e. specific searches in the B2FIND catalogue for one of the facets listed in the B2FIND schema (see *03.a-map-metadata.md* ).

Errors are returned as standard *HTTP errors*, e.g. the infamous **404** if the site is not available or are returned as json strings as below where you search for a *coolfacet* in B2FIND:

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=&coolfacet=Biology
```

**NOTE**, if you are using your own CKAN instance to follow this tutorial please replace *b2find.eudat.eu* with the URL pointing to your CKAN instance.

#### Example 1 : List communities integrated in B2FIND

```sh
(http://b2find.eudat.eu//api/3/action/group_list)
```
results in
```sh
{
   "help": "Return a list of the names of the site's groups.\n\n    :param order_by: the field to sort the list by, must be ``'name'`` or\n      ``'packages'`` (optional, default: ``'name'``) Deprecated use sort.\n    :type order_by: string\n    :param sort: sorting of the search results.  Optional.  Default:\n        \"name asc\" string of field name and sort-order. The allowed fields are\n        'name' and 'packages'\n    :type sort: string\n    :param groups: a list of names of the groups to return, if given only\n        groups whose names are in this list will be returned (optional)\n    :type groups: list of strings\n    :param all_fields: return full group dictionaries instead of  just names\n        (optional, default: ``False``)\n    :type all_fields: boolean\n\n    :rtype: list of strings\n\n    ", 
   "success": true, 
  "result": ["aleph", "b2share", "cessda", "clarin", "dariah", "datacite", "earlinet", "enes", "gbif", "ist", "ivoa", "narcis", "pandata", "pdc", "sdl", "theeuropeanlibrary"]}
```

#### Example 2 : Free text search

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=europe
```
results in 1988 found datasets. The lengthy output is not shown here.

#### Example 3 : Using the `textual` facets

##### Example 3.a : Filter for a community (or group)
 In B2FIND communities are mapped to CKAN groups. To filter e.g. all datasets belonging to the community `CLARIN` enter 

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=&groups=clarin
```

##### Example 3.b : Search for a creator
 The facet *Creator* corresponds to the CKAN field *author*. To filter e.g. all datasets created by `Amanda Brown` enter 

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=&author=Amanda+Brown
```

##### Example 3.c : Search for a discipline
**NOTE**, the following searches are dependent on the existence of certain facets that might not exist in your CKAN instance. Please use *b2find.eudat.eu* instead.

The facet *Discipline* is a special facet in the B2FIND schema but not a default field offered by CKAN. So it makes only sense to search in the B2FIND catalogue - except you have as well defined a facet 'Discipline' in the schema of your own CKAN instance. To filter all B2FIND datasets assigned to the discipline `Biology` enter 

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=&discipline=Biology
```

#### Example 4 : Coverage search 

##### Example 4.a : Geospatial search
This facet is only available if you installed the extention *ckan-timeline* in your CKAN installation. If you want to search for all datasets, which have an overlap with the a region covering (the main part of) the European continent, use the facet *ext_bbox* and the according latitudes and longitudes of the box:

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=&ext_bbox=-20.0%2C31.0%2C45.0%2C61.0
```

##### Example 4.b : Temporal search
This facet is only available if you have installed the extention *ckanext-timeline* in your CKAN installation. If you want to search for all datasets, which have an overlap with the 20th century, use the facets *ext_timeline_end* and *ext_timeline_end* for the start and end time of this periode, accordingly. Note that the values given here are in seconds since the calendar year 1:

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=&ext_timeline_start=59934719570&ext_timeline_end=63314340297
```

Example 5 : Combined search

You can combine several searches for facets. If you want e.g. run all the searches in the examples above in one run, you can enter the request in which you arrange all single facet searches into a line :

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=&ext_timeline_start=59934719570&ext_timeline_end=63314340297&.....
```

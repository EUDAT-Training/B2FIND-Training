# The Search Application Programming Interface (API)
This document describes how you can interact with a CKAN site by submitting HTTP requests using the CKAN API, on which as well the B2FIND API is based on. For details see the [API guide of CKAN] (http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/index.html). 

##Prerequisites

### 1. Internet browser

Supported and tested are

1. Firefox, version later than 45.x.y
2. Google Chrome, version later than 51.x.y

### 2. CKAN instance 
Your own CKAN installation (see module *04-install-CKAN.md*) or access to the [B2FIND portal] (http://b2find.eudat.eu) (we are open !). Please reset in the following the variable <CKAN_URL> with the URL of the used CKAN site.

## Usage

### 1. Usage of the B2FIND API

You can use directly *CKANâ€™s Action API*, version 3, where a request has the following form 
```sh
http://<CKAN_URL>/api/3/action/<function>[?q=[&<facet>=]<value>]
```
whereby the partly optional parameters assign :
 
- <CKAN_URL> is the URL of the CKAN site used,
- <function> is one of the API functions as `group_list` etc. ,
- <facet> is a field of the used schema (in case of B2FIND the B2FIND schema, see ...) and
- <value> is the corresponding value searched for 

A submission returns (if it not run in an `http error`) as response a JSON dictionary with three keys:

- "help": the documentation string for the function you called.
- "success": true or false.
- "result": the returned result from the function you called, i.e. a list of (dictioanries describing) the records fulfilling the search criteria.

You can enter these http requests directly in the address field of your browser or submit it from command line with the command `curl`.

We illustrate this with the following 'search use cases', i.e. specific searches in the B2FIND catalogue for one of the facets listed in the B2FIND schema (see *03.a-map-metadata.md* ).

#### Example 1 : List communities integrated in B2FIND

```sh
[http://<CKAN_URL>/api/3/action/group_list](http://<CKAN_URL>/api/3/action/group_list)
```
results in
```sh
{
   "help": "Return a list of the names of the site's groups.\n\n    :param order_by: the field to sort the list by, must be ``'name'`` or\n      ``'packages'`` (optional, default: ``'name'``) Deprecated use sort.\n    :type order_by: string\n    :param sort: sorting of the search results.  Optional.  Default:\n        \"name asc\" string of field name and sort-order. The allowed fields are\n        'name' and 'packages'\n    :type sort: string\n    :param groups: a list of names of the groups to return, if given only\n        groups whose names are in this list will be returned (optional)\n    :type groups: list of strings\n    :param all_fields: return full group dictionaries instead of  just names\n        (optional, default: ``False``)\n    :type all_fields: boolean\n\n    :rtype: list of strings\n\n    ", 
   "success": true, 
  "result": ["aleph", "b2share", "cessda", "clarin", "dariah", "datacite", "earlinet", "enes", "gbif", "ist", "ivoa", "narcis", "pandata", "pdc", "sdl", "theeuropeanlibrary"]}
```

#### Example 2 : Free text search

```sh
http://<CKAN_URL>/api/3/action/package_search?q=europe
```
results in 1988 found datasets. The lengthy output is not shown here.

#### Example 3 : Using the `textual` facets

##### Example 3.a : Filter out a community (or group)
 In B2FIND correspond communities to CKAN groups. To filter out e.g. all datasets belonging to the community `CLARIN` enter 

```sh
http://<CKAN_URL>/api/3/action/package_search?q=&groups=clarin
```

##### Example 3.b : Search for a creator
 In B2FIND correspond the facet *Creator* to the CKAN field *author*. To filter out e.g. all datasets created by `Amanda Brown` enter 

```sh
http://<CKAN_URL>/api/3/action/package_search?q=&author=Amanda+Brown
```

##### Example 3.c : Search for a discipline
Discipline is a facet of the B2FIND schema and not a default field by CKAN. So it makes only sense to search in the B2FIND catalogue - except you have as well defined a facet 'Discipline' in the schema of your own CKAN instance. To filter out e.g. all B2FIND datasets assigned to the discipline `Biology` enter 

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=&discipline=Biology
```

#### Example 4 : Coverage search 

##### Example 4.a : Geospatial search
This facet is only available if you have installed the extention *ckan-timeline* in your CKAN installation, as it is done for B2FIND. If you want to search for all datasets, which have an overlap with the a region covering (the main part of) the European continent, use the facet *ext_bbox* and the according latitudes and longitudes of the box :

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=&ext_bbox=-20.0%2C31.0%2C45.0%2C61.0
```

##### Example 4.b : Temporal search
This facet is only available if you have installed the extention *ckanext-timeline* in your CKAN installation, as it is done for B2FIND. If you want to search for all datasets, which have an overlap with the 2oth century , use the facets *ext_timeline_end* and *ext_timeline_end* for the start and end time of this periode, accordingly. Note that the values given here are in seconds since the calendar year 1 :

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=&ext_timeline_start=59934719570&ext_timeline_end=63314340297
```

Example 5 : Combined search

You can combine now several searches for facets together. If you want e.g. run all the searches in the examples above in one run, you can enter the request in whioch you arrange all single facet searches into a line :

```sh
http://b2find.eudat.eu/api/3/action/package_search?q=&ext_timeline_start=59934719570&ext_timeline_end=63314340297&.....
```

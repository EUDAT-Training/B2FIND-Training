# Search using the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the CKAN (B2FIND) portal
This document describes the functionality of the graphical user interface (GUI) of B2FIND. This is illustrated by a use case that aims in filtering out a subset of datasets which fulfill several search criteria. 

## Prerequisites

### 1. Internet browser
Supported and tested browsers are

1. Firefox, version 45 or later
2. Google Chrome, version 51 or later

Assure that JavaScript is enabled. 

### 2. CKAN instance
Your own CKAN installation (see module [Install CKAN](./04-install-CKAN.md)) or access to the [B2FIND portal](http://b2find.eudat.eu) (we are open !).

If you want to use your own CKAN installation or the [CKAN demo](http://demo.ckan.org/), please open the respective website. In this case you can use the search functionality which comes with the default CKAN installation or those that have been installed in the demo version. That means that some queries we use here only work for the B2FIND portal.

## Usage

### 1. Usage of the 'Facetted Search'

<img align="right" src="img/B2FIND_FacettedSearch.png" width="300px">
We will demonstrate the facetted search employed by the [B2FIND portal](http://b2find.eudat.eu). Please open the website `http://b2find.eudat.eu` and enter the tab `Facetted Search` (or click on the `Datasets` tab in other CKAN instances). 

On the top you find a general query field for [free text search](#FreeTextSearch) and ondiv the left-hand in the navigation bar side several preimplemented interfaces and pop up menues are provided to perform [facetted search](FacettedSearch).

Submission results are shown in the panel on the right hand side of the page. By default, i.e. upon initial opening of the page `Facetted search` you will find a list of all datasets.

In the following sections we illustrate the usage of the interface by inspecting several 'search use cases', i.e. specific searches in the B2FIND catalogue for the facets listed in the [B2FIND schema](./B2FIND-schema.md) ).

### 2. Some simple requests
We start with some simple list requests.

#### List Communities (groups)
<img align="right" src="img/B2FIND_Communities.png" width="260px">

Clicking on the tab `Communities` in the top of the website results in a view of the logos of the communities integrated in B2FIND.

By clicking on one of these logos more detailed information about the community is shown.

In other installations of CKAN, as in the [CKAN demo site](http://demo.ckan.org), you can instead use the tab 'Groups'.

**Exercise 1** : Get more information of the community `PDC`. Check their website and get some information about the kind of research this community is involved with ? 

**Exercise 2** : List all tags (keywords) available for the community `CLARIN`.

**Exercise 3** : List all datasets (packages). How many records does the B2FIND catalogue comprise ? 



### 3. <a name="FacettedSearch"></a> Facetted search
In the following sub section we explain first how to search on single facets
and finally we provide the result of a full combined search, which leads hopefully to the desired results our researcher needs for her own study.   


#### <a name="FreeTextSearch"></a> Free text search

<img align="right" src="img/B2FIND_ResultPage_FreeText_coast.png" width="260px">
The graphical user interface provides a field for free text search (next to the questionmark). All records will be fetched that mention in their body somewhere the test you entered there. E.g. entering `coast` in the field results in the page shown on the right.

**Excercise 4** : Search not only for `coast`, but as well for `coastline` and `coast line`. How you interprete the results ?

#### Textual facets
In the navigation bar on the left search interfaces for the textual facets *Tags*, *Creator*, *Discipline*, *Language* and *Publisher* are offered. If you click on one of the facet fields a list of clickable values is displayed and a autocomplete field for filtering are opened.

##### `Community` (or `Group`)
<img align="right" src="img/B2FIND_SearchCommunity_PDC.png" width="260px" border="2">
For the sake of this example, we assume you want filter for datasets of the B2FIND catalogue belonging to the community `PDC`. Thus, we  open the top-down menue of 'Communities' and choose the value `PDC`.   

<img align="right" src="img/CKAN_SearchGroup_governo.png" width="260px">
In case of a CKAN instance where the field `Community` is not implemented as a searchable CKAN field, you can instead search for one of the `group`'s listed under the tab `Groups`.    


<div style="clear: both"></div>


##### Discipline

The facet *Discipline* is defined only in the [B2FIND schema](B2FIND-schema.md)) and there is no related CKAN default field.

Again we first display all available disciplines and shrink the resulting value list to all including 'Env'. Finally, filter for all datasets belonging to a specific research field, in this example we choose `Environmental Science`.

<img align="left" src="img/B2FIND_ShowDisciplines.png" width="260px">
<img align="centre" src="img/B2FIND_ShrinkDisciplines_Env.png" width="260px">
<img align="right" src="img/B2FIND_SelectDiscipline_EnvironmentalScience.png" width="260px">   


##### Creator (or Author)
In B2FIND the facet `Creator` corresponds to the CKAN default field `Author` and a full list of available names can be shown again by clicking on the corresponding facet field in the navigation bar.

To filter all datasets created by 'Dustin Whalen' we use first the autocomplete functionality by entering 'Wh' in the corresponding field `Filter` to shrink the list over shown values to a manageable number.

Finally we can select the desired name:

<img align="left"   src="img/B2FIND_ShowCreators.png" width="260px">
<img align="centre" src="img/B2FIND_ShrinkCreators_Wh.png" width="260px">
<img align="right"  src="img/B2FIND_SelectCreator_DustinWhalen.png" width="260px">

** Excercise 5** : How many datasets are created by 'Dustin Whalen' ? Take into account that you get all `Creators` with last name `Whalen`. What is the general problem hereby ?

<img align="right" src="img/CKAN_SearchAuthor_Haseeb.png" width="260px">
In CKAN instances, which provide no graphical search interface for the facet *Author* or *Creator*, you can still use facetted searches by entering key-value pairs in the free text field, e.g. `author:Haseeb` as shown on the right hand side.   

** Excercise 6** : Who created the most datasets of `PDC`? 

#### Coverage
We would now like to filter data objects which cover a specific region or periode. This information is only available for a subset of the metadata records in B2FIND and CKAN.

For these facets describing coverage the additional implementation of [CKAN extensions](https://github.com/ckan/ckan/wiki/List-of-extensions) are needed, as done for the B2FIND service and at least the geospatial search as well for the CKAN demo site.

##### Geospatial Coverage (Filter by Location)
This feature is implemented in B2FIND through the adapted CKAN extension [ckanext-spatial](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-spatial).

<img align="right" src="img/B2FIND_FilterByLocation_DrawRectangleButton.png" width="260px">
Imagine we want to filter all datasets their spatial extent has an overlap with a small region around the coast line at the northern border between Alaska and Canada.
For this click on the 'Draw Rectangle' button in the top right of the world map widget of the 'Filter of Location' interface, 
<img align="right" src="img/B2FIND_FilterByLocation_AlaskaCanadaCoast.png" width="200px">
then select the desired region by dragging the cursor over the related box in the world map and press finally the 'Apply' button.   

** Excercise 7** : Which continents are covered by `PDC` datasets ? 

##### Temporal coverage (*Filter by Time*)
This facet is developed and implemented in B2FIND through the CKAN extension [ckanext-timeline](https://github.com/EUDAT-B2FIND/ckanext-timeline).


<img align="right" src="img/B2FIND_FilterByTimeChart.png" width="260px">
To search for all datasets whose temporal extent overlaps with the 20th century, click on the `Filter by time` button to open the widget chart.   

<img align="right" src="img/B2FIND_FilterByTime_SelectStartEndValues.png" width="260px">
Now, you can pre-select the time period at the bottom of the `Histogram` that overlaps with the 20th century. This results in a graph showing `Number of datasets` over `Time` in the upper part of the chart. Here you can also zoom into the time line by dragging the mouse cursor over a subsection and choose the periode in the time-line by holding the \<Ctrl\>-key and clicking with the left mouse key first on the start point and then on the end point, as shown in the figure above.

<img align="right" src="img/B2FIND_FilterByTime_StartEndValues.png" width="160px">
By pressing the `Apply` button the chart `Filter by Time` will be closed and the values (in seconds since the calendar year 0) will be shown in the fileds `Start:` and `End:`. (By hovering the mouse over these fields the date and time is displayed in a human readable form.)

<img align="right" src="img/B2FIND_LoopButton.png" width="80px">
Note, that the search request will not be excecuted until the `magnifier` button in the very right upper corner of the website is hit.   

** Excercise 8** : Find all datasets in B2FIND which cover the year 1880  ? 

##### Publication year
This facet is developed and implemented in B2FIND by the CKAN extension [ckanext-datesearch](https://github.com/EUDAT-B2FIND/ckanext-datesearch).

To search e.g. for all datasets which are published in the period of 1990 to 2016 go to `Publication Year` and select the appropriate decade widget to select the desired years.

<img align="left"  src="img/B2FIND_PublYear_ChooseDecade.png" width="270px">
<img align="centre" src="img/B2FIND_PublYear_ChooseYear.png" width="270px">
<img align="right" src="img/B2FIND_PublYear_Result.png" width="260px">    

** Excercise 8** : Find all datasets in B2FIND that are published before 333 ? Analyse and interprete the result. 

### 4. Combined search
The combination of the single requests above corresponds to the following use case.

> A scientist is interested in research data on polar coasts.
> She knows that the 'Polar Data Catalogue' offers access
> to this kind of data. Furthermore, she knows that her colleague Dustin published
> some interesting datasets about this topic in the past 26 years.
> In the first step she restricts the search result on research concerning coasts
> to the 20th century. In the second step she filters for studies on a particular
> coastal region at the northern boarder between Alaska and Canada.

In other words search for all datasets that fulfill each of the following criteria :

1. The word `coast` is found in the full text body of the metadata record
2. The data belongs to the community *PDC*
3. The data is *created* by `Dustin Whalen`
4. The data is origined from the discipline `Environmental Science`
5. The spatial extent has an intersection with a small section of the northern costal line at the border between Alaska and Canada
6. The temporal coverage has an overlap with the `20th century` (maybe this leads to no further restriction because the subset of datasets contain no information about their temporal coverage or the latter lies already within the selected period) 
7. The data is published after `1990` and before `2016`

The sequential excecution of all associated search requests will step by step reduce the set of `datasets found` and finally lead to the following result page :

<img align="centre" src="img/B2FIND_CombinedSearch_Result3.png">

Above the list of the dataset titles the choosen textual facets are shown. By clicking on the related crosses in the value fields each `faceted filtering` can be undone again.

In the navigation bar on the left the spatial and temporal extent is shown. You can reverse one ore multiple of these selections by pressing the `Clear` button in the asociated widget.

**Excercise 9 ** : Combine all these search criteria by conducting several search requests sequentially. Try different orders and modified values for teh single requests.

**Excercise 10 ** : Build your own search use case and analyes and interprete the results.

# Specification of metadata
This document describes the specification of the provided metadata.


## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites

### 1. Spreadsheet template
Each data provider who intends to publish metadata has to fill out the excel spreadsheet **Community-B2FIND_mapping.template.xlsx**. Please open the excel sheet with an appropriate office program.

## Specification
This is done by filling out the excel spreadsheet above.
In the first tab you find general instructions how to do this.
In this module we care about the first two tabs 'General Information' and 'Metadata specification'.

### 1. General Information
Open the tab **General Information** and provide the asked information :

### 2. Metadata Specification
Open the tab **Metadata Specification** and provide the asked information as far as available. This information is more complex and ... to answer and so discussed subject by subject

1. Availability and generation of metadata : ....
  * Question 1.a : Are there metadata available at all ?
  * Question 1.b : Do you have a workflow or a dedicated process, how metadata are generated ?
  
2. Formats and Maturity 
  * Question 2.a : Do your metadata records conform to a well-defined format, ontology or schema? (If there are multiple schemas, please list and answer for each below.)
  * Question 2.b : Is it formally defined (e.g. using XML Schema)?
....

[comment]: <> (by HEW: makes likely no sense to copy the whole excel tab here and discuss all questions in deatail ??? On the other hand this is the most important part of the community outreach : If these questions are answered the rest is just some configuration, server setup and python coding (boring technical stuff :-) ))

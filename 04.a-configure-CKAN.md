# Configure CKAN
This document describes how to configure your CKAN instance for your specific needs.


## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites

### 1. CKAN server installation
Of course you need a running CKAN instance. For installation see the previous module [Install CKAN](04-install-CKAN.md).

### 2. Internet connection and browser
Supported and tested are:
1. Firefox, version 45 or later
2. Google Chrome, version 51 or later

## Configuration

We link here to the CKAN documentation [Configuration Options](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html)
and explain here only a few basic settings.

### 1. The CKAN configuration file
is located at `/etc/ckan/default/production.ini`
You can e.g. edit the *Frontal settings* according to your needs.

To illustrate, how this works we change the title of the portal entry page, the description and the logo. For the latter the according picture has to been made available to the path where CKAN expects the images for the html pages 
```sh
$ sudo cp img/fish-and-chips.jpg /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan/ckan/public/base/images/
```

Now edit please the settings in `production.ini` as follows : 

```sh
...
## Front-End Settings
ckan.site_title = Fish and Chips Repository
ckan.site_logo = /images/fish-and-chips.jpg
ckan.site_description = The great repository for research about fish, chips and other interesting science
...
```

To make the changes active, you have to restart the apache and the nginx server :

```sh
$ sudo service apache2 restart
$ sudo service nginx restart
```

**Excercise** 
Adapt the *Email settings* in `/etc/ckan/default/production.ini`.

### 2. Creating a sysadmin user

This has to be done using the `paster` command in an activated virtual environment and in your CKAN source directory :

```sh
$ . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate
(default)$ cd /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckan
(default)$ paster sysadmin add rda_admin -c /etc/ckan/default/production.ini
User "rda_admin" not found
Create new user: rda_admin? [y/n]y
Password: 
Confirm password: 
Creating rda_admin user
Added rda_admin as sysadmin
```

Please remember this user and password for the sub following module, where you need it !

# Configure CKAN
This document describes how to configure your CKAN instance for your specific needs.


## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites

### 1. CKAN server set up
Of course you need a running CKAN instance. For installation see the previous module [Install CKAN](04-install-CKAN.md).

### 2. Internet connection and browser

1. Firefox, version 45 or later
2. Google Chrome, version 51 or later

## Configuration

We link here to the CKAN documentation [Configuration Options](http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/maintaining/configuration.html)
and explain here only a few basic settings.

### 1. The CKAN configuration file
is located at `/etc/ckan/default/production.ini`
You can e.g. edit the *Frontal settings* according to your needs, e.g. :

## Front-End Settings

To make the changes active, you have to restart the apache and the nginx server :

# Semantic Mapping of Metadata
This document describes how to convert, map and homogenize the community specific structured and formated XML records to JSON records formated and structured in the B2FIND schema (or any other schema). 


## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites

### 1. Spreadsheet template
For this part the tab **Mapping V n.m (YYMMDD)** in the excel spreadsheet **Community-B2FIND_mapping.template.xlsx** has to be filled out. Typically at this stage already a first draft for your community is created by the B2FIND team. 

Please open the excel sheet with an appropriate office program.

### 2. The mapping software
For mapping we use the python script ```sh mdmanger.py (mode ‘m’ and ‘v’)``` and mapfiles which enable you to perform a default mapping from DublinCore XML records to CKAN compatible JSON records formatted in B2FIND scheme. 

### 3. Some XML samples
The mapping script expects that the XML files to map resides in the directory ```sh oaidata/<Project-name>```.


## The Mapping process

### 1. The mapping rules

#### 1.a. Take an existing map file as template  
To transform XML files formated in DublinCore to CKAN compatible JSON files we have first to specify adn define according mapping rules. 
For this we create so called map files. As a template we take a mapfile already configured for metadata harvested from **Datacite**. Please copy this to a file tagged with your *<ProjectName>*  :

´´´sh
cp mapfiles/datacite-oai_dc.xml mapfiles/<ProjectName>-oai_dc.xml
´´´

The mapping rules in this configuration file can now adapted to the specific requirements of your project.

#### 2. The transformation of the XML files to JSON files is executed by :
´´´sh
./mdmanager.py --mode m -c <ProjectName>
´´´

Possibly you have to correct and adapt your mapping to assure fault-free operation. If the program finished successfully chek please the resulting JSON files in your project directory
´´´sh
/oaidata/<ProjectName>-oai_dc/<mdsubset>/json
´´´

# Mapping of Metadata
This document describes how to convert, map and homogenize community specific structured and formated XML records to B2FIND schema JSON records.

## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites

### 1. The script mdmanger.py
The python script [`mdmanger.py`](00.b-mdmanager-script.md) is used in the mode `m` for this training module.

### 2. Spreadsheet template
If you are a community interested to publish your metedata within EUDAT-B2FIND, description of the specific mapping to the B2FIND schema is needed. For this the tab **Mapping V n.m (YYMMDD)** in the excel template **Community-B2FIND.template.xlsx** has to be filled out (see [Specification of metadata](01.a-specify-metadata.md) ).

However, for this training it is not needed. We will continue with the fishproject as an example.

### 3. The mapping files
The mapping files are configuration files named according to this pattern ```<community>-<mdformat>.xml```. We provide some examples in the directory `mapfiles`. If you already followed part 01.b you will find your mapping for the *fishproject* here. The specific files define the mapping rules for XML records, originated from <community> and formated in <mdformat>.  

### 4. The XML samples
The mapping script expects that the XML files to map reside in the directory ```oaidata/<Community>-<MDformat>```.

## The Mapping process
### 1. Configuration of the mapping

According to the community *Data Cite* and the project *Fish Project* we provide already mapping files containing mapping (so called XPATH) rules in the directory `mapfiles/` :

1. **fishProject-oai_dc.xml** for the mapping of the DublinCore elements in the XML records of the fishProject onto the B2FIND schema.
2. **datacite-oai_dc.xml** for the mapping of the DublinCore elements in the DataCite XML records onto the B2FIND schema.

Depending on the successful excecution of the previous training modules as well the XML files are available :
1. **fishProject** samples : If you managed to generate metadata as described in *01.b-generate-metadata.md* the XML files reside already in ```oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/SET_1/xml```. 

If neither of them is the case please create the latter directory and copy the provided samples to this directory :
```sh
$ mkdir -p oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/SET_1/xml
$ cp samples/DC_examples/fishProject/xml/*.xml oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/SET_1/xml
``` 

2. **DataCite** samples : If you already managed to harvest metadata as described in *02.b-configure-OAI-harvester.md* the XML files reside already in ```oaidata/oaidata/datacite-oai_dc/ANDS.CENTRE-1/xml```. If not please create this directory and copy the provided samples to this directory :
```sh
mkdir -p oaidata/oaidata/datacite-oai_dc/ANDS.CENTRE-1/xml
cp samples/DC_examples/ANDS.CENTRE/*.xml oaidata/oaidata/datacite-oai_dc/ANDS.CENTRE-1/xml
```

To perform the mapping properly beside the mapping mode (option ```--mode m```) some parameters must be set to specify the mapping request.

This can be done by setting the options of the the script or by using the corresponding request line in the file ```harvest_list``` :

| Parameter | Description | Option | Pos. in request line | Comments | Example1 | Example 2 |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Community | Name of communtiy or project | -c or --community | 1 | Is used in pathes | fishproject | datacite |
| Source    | OAI-URL | -s or --source | 2 | Must be set, but irrelevant for the mapping |  http://localhost:8181/oai/provider |  http://oai.datacite.org/oai |
| Verb | The OAI-PMH request or `verb` | --verb | 3 | Not relevant for the mapping | ListIdentifiers | ListRecords | 
| MDprefix  | (OAI) meta data format | --mdprefix | 4 | Set during OAI harvesting | oai_dc | oai_dc |
| Subset    | (OAI) subset | --mdsubset | 5 | If not set during OAI harvesting, it's set to SET_# | SET_1 | ANDS.CENTRE-1_1 | 

E.g. for the 'fishProject' (and with the subset `sample`, as set in module 01.b) we submit the script with the approprirate options :   
```sh
$ ./mdmanager.py --mode m -c fishproject -s http://localhost:8181/oai/provider --mdsubset sample_1 --mdprefix oai_dc
```

If you have set these options for *fishproject* as a line in the configuration file `harvest_list` :
```sh
$ grep fishproject harvestlist
fishproject http://localhost:8181/oai/provider ListIdentifiers oai_dc
```

you can submit the script by only specifying the community in the command line options :

```sh
$ ./mdmanager.py --mode m -c fishproject
```

Both should result in the standard output

```sh
Version:  	2.0
Run mode:   	Mapping
Start : 	2016-11-07 14:47:43


|- Mapping started : 2016-11-07 14:47:43
	[==========          ]     4 ( 50%) in 0 sec
	[====================]     8 (100%) in 0 sec
   	|- Finished   |@ 14:47:45   |
	| Provided | Mapped | Failed |
	|        8 |      8 |      0 |
```

Possibly you have to correct and adapt your mapping to assure fault-free operation. If the program finished successfully check please the resulting JSON files in your project directory

´´´sh
$ ls oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/sample_1/json
´´´
and analyse and discuss the resulting JSON records.

**Excercise** 
Perform the mapping for the community 'DataCite'. Note that here the OAI subset ANDS-CENTRE-1 must be specified.

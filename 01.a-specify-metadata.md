# Warming up: Specification of metadata
B2FIND is EUDAT's meta data platform and in the course of this tutorial we will show you how to 

1. Install the underlying software
2. Convert metadata to match certain specifications
3. Harvest metadata from 3rd parties

In this section we would like to make you aware what metadata is and what kind of information is needed and turned into metadata records that can be included in a service like B2FIND.
If you intend to publish your metadata in B2FIND this is part is mandatory, for all others it is recommended to follow the instructions here to get an overview.
For this module you do not need any further technical knowledge.

## Spreadsheet template
We provide a template **Community-B2FIND_mapping.template.xlsx** in this repository. Please open it with an appropriate office program. 

## Specification
In the following we will guide you through the spreadsheet by following an imaginary use case called *fishProject*. 

### 0. Instructions
In the first tab you find the following instructions how to fill in the forms in the next tabs.

### 1. Generate a spreadsheet file for your use case 
Copy the template file into a new file, where in the new file name `Community` has to be replaced by the short name of the given community or project and the extension '.template' has to be removed.

As an example consider a project about fishes, which we will use in the subfollowing modules of this training as a 'use case'. If we choose the project name 'Fish Project' for this and a associated short name ( which has to be lower case and just one word ) `fishproject`, the associated spreadsheet is created as follows :

```sh
$ cp Community-B2FIND_template.xlsx fishproject-B2FIND.xlsx
```

### 2. Replacements in all sheets :
Open the spreadsheet with an appropriate office tool and perform the instructions given in the first table :

* Replace `Community` and `commShortname` with the full and the short name of your community, respectively.
I.e. for our example substitute in all tabs of ```fishproject-B2FIND.xlsx``` <Community> by `Fish project` and <commShortname> by `fishproject`.
* Replace `mdformat` with the OAI meta data format used.
We use Dublin Core as the OAI metadata format and substitute `mdformat` by the associated OAI abbrevition `oai_dc`.
* Update dates 'YYMMDD' and adapt the version (default is V 0.1) in the tab names each time you perform essential changes.

### 3. Adapt the content of the sheets

#### 3.a. General information : 
This should be filled out by represntatives of the community. This information will be partly used how the `community` or `project` will be presented and displayed in the CKAN (or B2FIND) portal :

Open the tab **General Information** and provide the asked information :

| Name                  | Value                  | Comments                                                                    |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Contact Persons       | `Your name(s) and email(s)` | The persons can be asked by the B2FIND team                 |
| Community Shortname   | fishproject        | This is the name used in the B2FIND code and GUI                            |
| Community Longname    | Fish Project            | This is the name used in the description part of the community  |
| Community Description | The great repository for research about fish, chips and other interesting science         | This text is used in the B2FIND portal for the description of the community |
| Community Homepage    | N/A | This is set as link in the Community Description                            |
| Community Logo        | https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/a2/42/e3/a242e361d6cc5883f6f5304ccea90c97.jpg | This logo is used in the B2FIND portal                                      |
| Community Portal      | N/A yet                |             |

#### 3.b. Harvesting : 
This corresponds to the module [Data Provider](02.a-configure-OAI-data_provider.md) and is only compulsory to be filled in if you intend to publish your metadata in EUDAT-B2FIND.  

Open the tab **Harvesting (YYMMDD)**.
As a community which wants to offer its metadata to B2FIND via an OAI-PMH endpoint you have to provide information on
* the OAI endpoint(s)
* the subsets of your metadata that needs to be harvested
The B2FND team will compete this information with the status and intervals of the harvesting
Once you followed [Data Provider](02.a-configure-OAI-data_provider.md) you can insert the specifications of your test OAI-PMH server.

#### 3.c. Metadata Specification
While these fields are not required to be filled out we still recommend it to get an overview.

Open the tab **Metadata Specification** and provide the information as far as known and available. This information is more complex and has to be answered and discussed subject by subject.

We do not follow this in detail in this tutorial. But it is a good excercise to answer the questions for the *fishproject*.

#### 3.d. Mapping : 
This corresponds to the modules [03.a Mapping of Metadata](03.a-map-metadata.md) and [03.a Validating of Metadata](03.b-validate-metadata.md) and can only filled out when you finished this stage of teh training. 

Open the tab **Mapping (YYMMDD)**.
For integration in B2FIND the first draft is filled out by the B2FIND team and then it will be iteratively updated and discussed with the representatives of the community.

# Specification of metadata
This document describes the specification of your metadata.
For people who intend to publish their metadata in B2FIND we developed an excel spread sheet, which iteratively and incrementally will be filled out by the community representatives in close consultation with the B2FIND team.

Also if you in the first instance not intend to publish metadata in EUDAT-B2FIND, we recommend to fill out the tables. 

## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites

### Spreadsheet template
A template of the excel spreadsheet **Community-B2FIND_mapping.template.xlsx** comes with the training material. Please open it with an appropriate office program.

To illustrate this, we will take the use cases used during the course of this training : Imagine you work - as a researcher or a data manager - at the research institute *Fish and Chips Center* and received the order from your boss to publish the metadata of the project *fishProject*. ...  

## Specification
This is done by filling out the excel spreadsheet above.

[comment]: <> (by HEW: makes likely no sense to copy the whole excel tab here and discuss all questions in deatail ??? On the other hand this is the most important part of the community outreach : If these questions are answered the rest is just some configuration, server setup and python coding (boring technical stuff :-) ))

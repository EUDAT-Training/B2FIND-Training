# Specification of metadata
This document describes the specification of your metadata.
For people who intend to publish their metadata in B2FIND we developed an excel spread sheet, which iteratively and incrementally will be filled out by the community representatives in close consultation with the B2FIND team.

Also if you in the first instance not intend to publish metadata in EUDAT-B2FIND, we recommend to fill out the tables. 

## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites

### Spreadsheet template
A template of the excel spreadsheet **Community-B2FIND_mapping.template.xlsx** comes with the training material. Please open it with an appropriate office program.

To illustrate this, we will take the use cases described in *README.md*.  

## Specification
This is done by filling out the tabs in the above mentioned excel spreadsheet above.

### 0. Instruction
In the first tab you find the following instructions which we perform for the use case *fishProject* :

### 1. Generate a spreadsheet file for your use case 
Copy the template file into a new file, where in the new file name `Community` has to be replaced by the short name of the given community name and and the extension '.template' has to be removed, e.g. :
```sh
$ cp Community-B2FIND_template.xlsx fishproject-B2FIND.xlsx
```

### 2. Replace in all sheets :
    a.  <Community> and <commShortname> with the full or the short name of your community, respectively
> E.g. replace in all tabs of ```fishproject-B2FIND.xlsx``` <Community> by `Fish project` and <commShortname> by `fishproject`.
> Note : <commShortname> should be replaced by a lower case word, because it is used during the ingestion worklfow as parameter. 
    b. <mdformat> with the OAI meta data format used (e.g. Dublin core, ISO19...),
> We use Dublin Core as the OAI metadata format and substitute <mdformat> by the associated abbrevition `oai_dc`
    c. edit dates 'YYMMDD' and adapt the version (default is V 0.1) in the tab names.
> If you update e.g. the mapping specification in the associated tab on 9th September 2016 and add new information about the mapping of the *Fish Project* change the tab name `Mapping <comm> <set> (YYMMDD)` to `Mapping fishProject (160909)`.


 
### 3. Adapt the content of the several sheets
#### 3.a. General information : 
This should be filled out by representatives of the community. The information here will be used to display and present the community in the B2FIND portal :


Open the tab **General Information** and provide the asked information :

| Name                  | Value                  | Comments                                                                    | Issues |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Contact Persons       | Name(s) and email(s)   | The persons can be asked by the B2FIND team and vice versa                  |        |
| Community Shortname   | <commShortname>        | This is the name used in the B2FIND code and GUI                            |        |
| Community Longname    | <Community>            | This is the name used in the description part of the community              |        |
| Community Description | <Community> is â€¦       | This text is used in the B2FIND portal for the description of the community |        |
| Community Homepage    | URL to the logo figure | This is set as link in the Community Description                            |        |
| Community Logo        | URL to the logo figure | This logo is used in the B2FIND portal                                      |        |
| Community Portal      | URL                    |                                                                             |        |
#### 3.b. Harvesting : The information about OAI endpoints and 'appropriate' OAI subsets and meta data formats etc. (columns A-E) has to be given from community site. The status and numbers of the B2FIND ingestion (harvested, mapped and uploaded records) has to be filled out by the B2FIND team  

#### 3.d. Mapping : The first draft is filled out by the B2FIND team and then it will be iteratively updated and discussed with the representatives of the community

#### 3.c. Metadata Specification
Open the tab **Metadata Specification** and provide the asked information as far as available. This information is more complex and ... to answer and so discussed subject by subject

1. Availability and generation of metadata : ....
  * Question 1.a : Are there metadata available at all ?
  * Question 1.b : Do you have a workflow or a dedicated process, how metadata are generated ?
2. Formats and Maturity 
  * Question 2.a : Do your metadata records conform to a well-defined format, ontology or schema? (If there are multiple schemas, please list and answer for each below.)
  * Question 2.b : Is it formally defined (e.g. using XML Schema)?
....

[comment]: <> (by HEW: makes likely no sense to copy the whole excel tab here and discuss all questions in deatail ??? On the other hand this is the most important part of the community outreach : If these questions are answered the rest is just some configuration, server setup and python coding (boring technical stuff :-) ))

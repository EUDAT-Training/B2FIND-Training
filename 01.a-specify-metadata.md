# Specification of metadata
This document describes the specification of your metadata. 
For people who intend to publish their metadata in B2FIND this is mandatory.
Also if you in the first instance not intend to publish metadata in EUDAT-B2FIND, we recommend to fill out the tables.

## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

##Prerequisites

### Spreadsheet template
A template of the excel spreadsheet **Community-B2FIND_mapping.template.xlsx** comes with the training material. Please open it with an appropriate office program.  

## Specification
This is done by filling out the tabs in the a version of the excel spreadsheet above. To illustrate this, we will take the use case *FishProject* described in *README.md*.

### 0. Instructions
In the first tab you find the instructions how to adapt and fill out the tables for your 'use case'. This is explained again in detail in teh following sub sections.

### 1. Generate a spreadsheet file for your use case 
Copy the template file into a new file, where in the new file name `Community` has to be replaced by the short name of the given community or project and the extension '.template' has to be removed. 

We choose the here the name `Fish Project` for our use case and for the associated short name of the 'community' `*fishproject*`. 
> Note : This string should be one lower case word and only contain the 
> special character `_`, because it is used as variable in the python code and in the CKAN configuration. 

I.e. the associated spreadsheet is created as follows :
```sh
$ cp Community-B2FIND_template.xlsx fishproject-B2FIND.xlsx
```

### 2. Replacements in all sheets :
Open the generated spreadsheet with an appropriate office tool and perform the instructions given in the first table :

* Replace `Community` and `commShortname` with the full and the short name of your community, respectively.
I.e. for our example substitute in all tabs of ```fishproject-B2FIND.xlsx``` <Community> by `Fish project` and <commShortname> by `fishproject`.
* Replace `mdformat` with the OAI meta data format used.
Here we use Dublin Core as the OAI metadata format and substitute `mdformat` by the associated OAI abbrevition `oai_dc`.
* Update dates 'YYMMDD' and adapt the version (default is V 0.1) in the tab names each time you perform essential changes.

### 3. Adapt the content of the tab's
When this can be done depends on the stage and status of the excecuted workflow steps.

#### 3.a. General information : 
This should be filled out at the beginning. This information will be partly used how the `community` or `project` will be presented and displayed in the CKAN (or B2FIND) portal :

Open the tab **General Information** and provide the asked information :

| Name                  | Value                  | Comments                                                                    |
|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Contact Persons       | `Your name(s) and email(s)` | The persons can be asked by the B2FIND team                 |
| Community Shortname   | fishproject        | This is the name used in the B2FIND code and GUI                            |
| Community Longname    | Fish Project            | This is the name used in the description part of the community  |
| Community Description | The great repository for research about fish, chips and other interesting science         | This text is used in the B2FIND portal for the description of the community |
| Community Homepage    | N/A | This is set as link in the Community Description                            |
| Community Logo        | https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/a2/42/e3/a242e361d6cc5883f6f5304ccea90c97.jpg | This logo is used in the B2FIND portal                                      |
| Community Portal      | N/A yet                |             |

#### 3.b. Harvesting :
The associated tab is **Harvesting (YYMMDD)**.
  
This corresponds to the module [Data Provider](02.a-configure-OAI-data_provider.md) and is only imperative if you intend to publish your metadata in EUDAT-B2FIND.  

The information about OAI endpoints and 'appropriate' OAI subsets and meta data formats etc. (columns A-E) has to be given from community site. 
The status and numbers of the B2FIND ingestion (harvested, mapped and uploaded records) has to be filled out by the B2FIND team.  

#### 3.c. Metadata Specification
The associated tab is **Metadata Specification**.

While these fields does not have to be filled out mandatorily we recommend in any case to look at least to these questions and try to answer them.

Provide the asked information as far as known and available. This information is more complex and has to be answered and discussed subject by subject.

We go not in more detail here. But it is a good excercise to answer the questions for the *fishproject*.

#### 3.d. Mapping : 
The associated tab is **Mapping (YYMMDD)**.

This corresponds to the modules [Mapping](03.a-map-metadata.md) and [Validation](03.b-validate-metadata.md) and can only fully filled out when we reached this stage of the training. 

For integration in B2FIND the first draft is filled out by the B2FIND team and then it will be iteratively updated and discussed with the representatives of the community.

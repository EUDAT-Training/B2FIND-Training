# Configuring an OAI harvester
This document describes how to configure your own OAI-PMH harvester based on a joai installation.
We will take you through the steps of how to harvest the *oai endpoint* of an existing repository.

##Prerequisites
1. [Installation of the jOAI software](02-install-jOAI.md) running in an Apache Tomcat. In the following we assume that the OAI server is running and accessible at `http://<fqdn or ip>/oai`, whereby <fqdn or ip> is the ip-address or fully qualified domain name of your OAI server.
2. Admin account :  If you start the first time the `Harvester` setup you are maybe prompted to login as user *admin*. By default the password is set as well to *admin*. Furthermore you can restrict access to your server or to parts of the stored data as described in section [Repository security](02-install-jOAI.md#reposSecurity)
3. XML files provided in the OAI provider, see previous module [02.a Provide metadata](02.b-OAI-data_provider.md). We assume here at least that for the project *fishproject* some DublinCore XML records are available for harvesting.
4. (Optional) The script `mdmanger.py`
If you want to harvest from command line , you can use the python script - its usage described in detail in [`mdmanger.py`](00.b-mdmanager-script.md) - in processing mode `--mode h`. 

## Configuration and customization
How XML files can be harvested is here explained with the provided DublinCore XML files for the *fishproject*(see [02.a Providing metadata](01.a-OAI-data_provider.md)). But of course it works with any other XML files, as far they are made available in your or another accessable OAI data provider as can be experienced in the excercises.

### Add a new Harvester

Open the GUI of joai at `http://<fqdn or ip>/oai`. In teh menue `Harvester` you will find the option `Setup and Status`. Go to this page and click on `Add new harvest`. This form is used to set up the harvester.

To this end we need to provide information on the repository we would like to harvest. 
In the following table settings for our usecases `fishproject` and `seisnet` and as well for two external repositories, namely for the *GFZ* (Geo Forschungszentrum Potsdam) und *DataCite* :

|{OAI parameters     |{{cs=4}}Examples                           }|
| Parameter | Fish Project | Seisnet Project | GFZ | DataCite |
|------------ | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |----------- |----------|
| Project name | `fishproject` | `seisnet` | `gfz` | `datacite` |
| OAI-Repository name | Fish project Repos | Seismic Network Repos | GFZ Repos | DataVite Archive |
| OAI-URL |{{cs=2}} `http://<fqdn or ip>/oai/provider` | ` http://doidb.wdc-terra.org/oaip/oai` | `http\://oai.datacite.org/oai` |
| OAI subset | `mdsubset` | None | `locations` | `DOIDB.SEISNET` | `ANDS.CENTRE-1` |
| OAI verb | `verb` |{{cs=4}} `ListIdentifiers` or `ListRecords`  |
| OAI MD format | `mdprefix` | `oai_dc` |  `oai_dc` |{{cs=2}} `oai_dc` or `oai_dublincore` |
[! Harvester specification !]

Some of the above settings are optional or can set in different ways.
Just play around with it.

(But please set the a subset (i.e. parameter `mdsubset` rsp. `set`) for harvesting from DataCite, since DataCite's full extent of metadata provided will be too large for testing purposes.)

For the `fishproject` it may look as

<img align="centre" src="img/jOAI_AddNewHarvest_fishproject1.png" width="800px">

Note that `/provider` is appended to the *provider* URL !

We specify here instead the 'default harvest location' the path `/home/rda/B2FIND-Training/oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/SET_1/xml`, because thsi directory will be accessed for the processing in the sub following training parts [03. and 04.]. Please create this directory beforehand and make it readable for all :
```sh
$ mkdir oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/SET_1/xml
$ chmod o+w oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/SET_1/xml
```

If you confirm the settings by clicking on `Save` the successful configuration will result in a new `Harvest Repository` :

<img align="centre" src="img/jOAI_AddNewHarvest_fishproject2.png" width="800px">

### Harvesting from an OAI provider
There are three ways to harvest from an OAI repository :
- Via the JOAI GUI by choosing `Manual Harvest` in the set ups of your `Harvester Repository's`
- Submit the OAI harvest requests via your browser address field
- Harvest from command line by using the script `mdmanager.py`
All options are illustrated with the use case `fishproject`. Feel free to try it out with other settings and other OAI repositories (see the excercices below).

#### Using the jOAI GUI
To trigger the harvesting you only need to click on the button `All` in the column `Manually Harvest` of the above created `Fish Project Repository`. If you do so, you will get asked :

<img align="centre" src="img/jOAI_Harvest_fishproject1.png" width="800px">

By clicking 'ok' the harvest request will be submitted and if you press 'View harvest history and progress' to monitor the progress :

<img align="centre" src="img/jOAI_Harvest_fishproject2.png" width="800px">

In the above case you can see that the last attempt seems to be successful terminated, but the previous not due to missing write permissions to the output directory. This was resolved by ecxecuting the corresponding `chmod` command above.

Please check now the content of this directory and compare one of the provided files with its harvested counterpart :
```sh
$ ls oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/SET_1/xml
-rw-rw-rw-. 1 k204019 k204019 718  8. Sep 11:05 Compressiceps-DC.xml
-rw-rw-rw-. 1 k204019 k204019 718  8. Dez 13:17 Compressiceps.xml
.........
$ $ diff -w oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/SET_1/xml/Compressiceps.xml oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/sample_1/xml/Compressiceps.xml
``` 

Beside differences in intends and line breaks both files - the provided and the harvested - should be the same.

#### Using an internet browser

You can as well perform harvesting requests by entering http requests in the address field of your internet browser. We try first to identify the OAI-URL by setting the OAI-verb to `Identify` :

<img align="centre" src="img/Browser_Harvest_fishproject1.png" width="800px">

Feel free to play around with the several 'OAI-verbs' as listed e.g. at [The OAI-PMH](http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#ProtocolMessages). Some of them - applied to our use case `fishproject` are listed in the following table

|{OAI verb | Description | Examplary result}|
| Identify | Returns available information about the OAI provider | see figure above |
| ListSets | Lists the defined OAI sets | e.g. the set `loactations` with description of its content |
| ListMetadataFormats | Lists all used metadata formats | e.g. `oai_dc`, the abbrevation for the DublinCore schema |
| ListIdentifiers | Lists all headers of available records | e.g. the identifiers belonging to the `seisnet` project  |
| ListRecords | Lists all availabel records | e.g. the records belonging to the `seisnet` project  |
 
> Note : The verbs `ListIdentifiers` and `ListRecords` requires the specification of the `metadataPrefix`, i.e. the metadata schema as you specified it above by the parameter `mdPrefix`.

#### Using the command line interface
You can use the python script `mdmanager.py` in the mode `h` to harvest directly from command line.

For this part we will specify a source file by the option `-s SOURCE` and use the parameter `verb` from the `Harvest Options` :

```sh
These options will be required to harvest metadata records from a data
provider (by default via OAI-PMH from the URL given by SOURCE).

--verb=STRING           Verbs or requests defining the mode of harvesting, can
                        be ListRecords(default) or ListIdentifers if OAI-PMH
                        used or e.g. 'works' if JSON-API is used
--fromdate=DATE         (Optional) Filter harvested files by date (Format: YYYY-MM-DD).
```

For the `fishproject` the corresponding command would be :


```sh
./mdmanager.py --mode h -c fishproject --source  http://localhsot:8181/oaiprovider
....

```
 
You can also set the `OAI request` in the file `harvest_list` (as provided in this git-repository) by adding a line with the following entries
```sh
ishproject http://localhost:8181/oai/provider ListIdentifiers oai_dc
```
Now you can skip as well the `SOURCE` option and just submit 
```sh
./mdmanager.py --mode h -c fishproject
```
what should yield in the same output. The harvested records are written to the same directory as above, but now the XML files are renamed by unique id numbers.

###Excercise :
Compare the corresponing files ...

#### <a name="Excercise1"></a> Excercise 1
If you made already some records available for the project `seisnet` in the previous module, you can set up a harvester for this records. Please set here `locations` for the optioanal parameter `SetSpec`.

#### <a name="Excercise2"></a> Excercise 2 
Add another `harvester` for harvesting from a subset of the DataCite repository. Please use the parameters as specified in the table above and don't forget to set the parameter `SetSpec` on `ANDS.CENTRE-1` for the optional parameter `SetSpec`. This configuration should result in a new `Harvest Repository` as shown in the following figure :

<img align="centre" src="img/jOAI_HarvestRepos1.png" width="800px">

```sh
./mdmanager.py --mode h -c datacite --source  http://oai.datacite.org/oai \
	--verb ListRecords --mdprefix oai_dc --mdsubset ANDS.CENTRE-1
```
 
Again you can set the paramters in the configuration file `harvest_lsit`, i.e. add a line

```sh
datacite  http://oai.datacite.org/oai  ListIdentifiers  oai_dc ANDS.CENTRE-1
```
and just submit 
```sh
./mdmanager.py --mode h -c datacite --mdsubset ANDS.CENTRE-1
Version:  	2.0
Run mode:   	Harvesting
Start : 	2016-10-31 16:12:09


|- Harvesting started : 2016-10-31 16:12:09
	|- Iterate through 39 records in 0 sec
	[==                  ]     4 ( 10%) in 0 sec
	[====                ]     8 ( 20%) in 0 sec
	[======              ]    12 ( 30%) in 1 sec
	[====================]    39 (100%) in 4 sec
```

and the harvested records are written to the corresponding directory :

```sh
ls oaidata/datacite-oai_dc/ANDS.CENTRE-1/xml/
11dff0d6-da94-55de-a5b5-0fdf3cf921d5.xml  92cd9237-ad3d-503e-8750-5ee326e48d9b.xml

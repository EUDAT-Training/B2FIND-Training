# Generation of metadata
This document describes how formated metadata records can be generated from given raw information. 

## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

## Prerequisites

### 1. Python and the convert script
* Python 2.7 or later
* The script ```md-convert.py``` is used for this training module and comes already with this training package.
* The pyton module *dublincore* can be installed by
```sh
pip install dublincore
```
> Note : If you still get an error like
```sh
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): dublincore in /home/xxx/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages
```
> you have to add this path to your Python path by
```sh
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/k204019/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
```

### 2. Some samples of raw data
Some examples of 'raw metadata', i.e. comma and tabulator seperated lists,are given in the directory *samples/RAW_data*.
```sh
ls samples/RAW_data
annotations.tsv  sample.csv  smallData.tsv
```

## Usage

### 1. Usage, help and syntax

Please check firts the usage of the script :
```sh
./md-convert.py -h
Usage: Usage : md-convert.py [options] SOURCE
Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTDIR, --outdir=OUTDIR
                        output directory for Dublincore XML files
  -c MAPFILE, --config=MAPFILE
                        configure mapping on the fly and store in MAPFILE
  -d DELIMITER, --delimiter=DELIMITER
                        the delimiter used in the original data
  -m MAPFILE, --mapfile=MAPFILE
                        The file that specifies the mapping from original to
                        DC fields
```

In the following we will use this script to convert comma or tabular seperated list of values to valid XML files formated in the [DublinCore](http://dublincore.org/) metadata schema. The usage of teh several options will explained there in more detail.


### 2. Creation of a mapfile
In a first step we define the mapping of each field in the header line of the sample file
```sh
$ head -1 samples/RAW_data/sample.csv 
Common name,Scientific name,Location,Temperament,Diet,Water,Size,Region of the Aquarium,Breeding
```
to one of the DublinCore elements (see ```sh mapfiles/dcelements.txt```) or of the DublinCore terms (see ```sh mapfiles/dcterms.txt```).

You are free by assigning the original fields to one of the dublincore fields. The only mandatory fields to set are ```dc:title``` and ```dc:identifier```, whereby the value of the latter is used to build the filename of the generated XML record. 

By calling the script with the csv file as argument and with the option -c <yourMapfile> you are asked for each input field to enter a valid DublinCore element or term, e.g.

```sh
./md-convert.py -c mapfiles/mymapfile.cvs samples/RAW_data/sample.csv
Target field for Common name : dc:identifier
Target field for Scientific name : dc:title
Target field for Location : dcterms:spatial
Target field for Temperament : dc:type
Target field for Diet : dcterms:requires
Target field for Water : dcterms:medium
Target field for Size : dcterms:extent
Target field for Region of the Aquarium : dcterms:provenance
Target field for Breeding : dcterms:created
```

This results not only in the newly generated mapping file ```sh mapfiles/mymapfile.cvs``` but as well the mapping is excecuted and the associated XML files are written to the output directory ```sh outdata```.

#### Excercise 2.1: Repeat the generation of mapfile and do your own mapping
#### Excercise 2.2: Check the mapping rules in the file you entered with the option ```sh -c ``` (in teh example above it's the file ```sh .
#### Excercise 2.3: Check the results, i.e. the generated XML files in the output directory,e.g. with the above mapping oen of teh resulted files looks as follows:

Optionally an output directory for the generated XML files can be indicated by option ```sh -o OUTPATH```.

```sh  
less myout/Compressiceps-DC.xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<metadata
    xmlns="http://example.org/myapp/"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">

        <dc:identifier>Compressiceps</dc:identifier>
        <dc:title>Haplochromis compressiceps</dc:title>
        <dc:type>Territorial</dc:type>
        <dcterms:created>Hard</dcterms:created>
        <dcterms:extent>5 inches</dcterms:extent>
        <dcterms:medium>PH 7.0 - 8.0, Temp. 73 - 77 F</dcterms:medium>
        <dcterms:provenance>Bottom</dcterms:provenance>
        <dcterms:requires>Omnivore</dcterms:requires>
        <dcterms:spatial>Lake Tanganyika</dcterms:spatial>
</metadata>
``` 

> Note : Here starts the issue of semantic mapping and 
> homogenisation of a research specific vocabulary to a common, 
> restricted vocabulary or schema as DublinCore. I.e. the mapping above is quite "formal", e.g. above *`Diet`* is mapped to *`dcterms:requires`*, but likely the intention of the DublinCore consortium by introducing the field *requires* was not in the sense of `a plant requires a specific diet`. So, if we want to cover these specific biological properties we have to add another extented shema, which covers the property 'Diet'. How this can be done is explained in the next section. 

To change the mapping rules to your needs you can instead - running the script repeatately with option ```-c``` - as well edit the mapfile, whereby the seperator ´´´sh >´´´ is used to seperate the original field name and the target Dublincore element, as shown here :

```sh 
$ cat mapfiles/mymapfile.cvs 
Common name>dc:identifier
Scientific name>dc:title
Location>dcterms:spatial
Temperament> dc:type
Diet>dcterms:requires
Water>dcterms:medium
Size> dcterms:extent
Region of the Aquarium>dcterms:provenance
Breeding>dcterms:created
```
 
### 2. Subfollowing converting
With an existing (and reviewed) mapfile the script can be repeatately called with the option ```sh -m MAPFILE```.

```sh
./md-convert.py -m mapfiles/myMapFile.cvs [ -o myOutPath ] samples/RAW_data/sample.csv
```

### 3. Check the results

The resulting XML files in should now compatible to the DublinCore metadata format.

Excercise 3.1: You can check this e.g. by one of the available XML validators, e.g. ```sh http://www.xmlvalidation.com/```.

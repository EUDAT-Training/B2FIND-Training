# Generation of metadata
Given metadata as spreadsheet we need to convert this metadata to valid xml files that conform with the Dublin Core specifications that can later be mapped to facets in B2FIND.
This document describes how to generate such metadata records from spreadsheet (comma and tab-separated) files. 

## Prerequisites

### 1. Python and the convert script
All functionality to convert spreadsheet data into well-formatted xml files is provided by the script [mdmanager.py](https://github.com/EUDAT-Training/B2FIND-Training/blob/master/mdmanager.py). 

To run the script you need:
* Python 2.7 or later
* Install the python package dublincore
 ```sh
 pip install dublincore
 ```
 > Note : If you get an error like
 ```sh
 Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): dublincore in /home/xxx/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages
 ```
 > you have to add this path to your Python path by
 ```sh
 export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/k204019/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
 ```

### 2. Some samples of raw data
Some examples of 'raw metadata', i.e. comma and tabulator seperated lists,are given in the directory *samples/RAW_data*.
```sh
ls samples/RAW_data
annotations.tsv  sample.csv  smallData.tsv
```
At the moment this part is fully tested with the comma separated lists in the file ```sample.csv```.

## The *mdmanager.py* script
The script *mdmanager.py* can be executed in different modes and provides procedures for the whole workflow how to come to unstructured metadata to entries in B2FIND/CKAN. In this part of the tutorial we will use the mode *g*. This mode conatins the functionality of generating XML metadata records from spreadsheet data.
Please refer to the table below for all possible modes and their meaning:
Mode | Explanation
------|-------------------
g| Generate XML metadata
h| Harvest XML files from a provider
c| Convert XML to B2FIND JSON format
m| Semantic mapping from community XML to B2FIND JSON format
v| Validate JSON records as compatible with B2FIND schema
o| 
u| Upload JSON records to B2FIND or another CKAN instance
d| Delete datasets from B2FIND or another CKAN instance

Please check first the usage of the script by :
```sh
./mdmanager.py -h
```
For this part we will specify a source file by the option `-s SOURCE` and use some of the `Generate and Harvest Options` :
```sh
These options are required to generate or harvest metadata from the specified sources.

--verb=STRING           Specifiers of the procesing request. In generation
                        mode this is the delimiter of the source (e.g.
                        'comma'(default) or 'tab' and in harvesting mode this
                        is a 'verb' supported by OAI-PMH ( e.g. ListRecords
                        (default) or ListIdentifers)
--mdsubset=STRING       Subset of the processed data meta data (for OAI-PMH
                        harvesting the OAI subset, if availbale)
--mdprefix=STRING       Meta data schema of the source (for OAI-PMH harvesting
                        the OAI metadata prefix
--fromdate=DATE         filter metadata to be processed by date (Format: YYYY-
                        MM-DD).
--target_mdschema=STRING
                        (Optional) Meta data schema of the target
```

In the following we show how you can convert comma or tabular seperated files to valid XML files formated in the [DublinCore](http://dublincore.org/) metadata schema. The usage of the several options mentioned above will be explained in the following.

### 1.2. Creation of a mapfile
In a first step we define the mapping of each field in the header line of the sample file
```sh
$ head -1 samples/RAW_data/sample.csv 
Common name,Scientific name,Location,Temperament,Diet,Water,Size,Region of the Aquarium,Breeding
```
to one of the DublinCore elements (see ```mapfiles/dcelements.txt```) or the DublinCore terms (see ```mapfiles/dcterms.txt```).

You are free by assigning the original fields to any one of the DublinCore fields. The only mandatory fields to set are ```dc:title``` and ```dc:identifier```, whereby the value of the latter is used to build the filename of the generated XML record. 

Beside the mode (`--mode g`, standing for generation) and the source (`-s FILE`, the path to the csv file) the following options are mandatory :
- ```-c COMMUNITY``` : a free choosen project or community name. Here and in the following modules we call our project *fishproject*.
- ```--mdprefix MDFORMAT``` : This is the target metadata schema, we choose here *oai_dc*, i.e. the Dublincore metadata schema.

Optionally a subset and the delimiter of the original source file can be specified.  
- ```--mdsubset MDSUBSET``` : The subset that determines the sub directory the generated XML files reside. Default is the subset `SET_1`, we choose here `sample`, resulting in the sub directory `sample_1` of the output path.
- ```--verb DELIMITER``` specifies the delimiter by which the sample data are separated, by default (and in our example) set to *comma*.

From these parameters the name for the mapfile is built as ```mapfiles/<community>-<mdprefix>.csv``` and the output path is combined to ```oaidata/<community>-<mdprefix>/<mdsubset>_1```.  

By calling the script for the first time, there will be no mapfile available. So you are asked for each original header field to enter a valid DublinCore element or term :

```sh
./mdmanager.py --mode g -c fishproject -s samples/RAW_data/sample.csv --mdprefix oai_dc --mdsubset sample --verb comma
...
|- Generation started : 2016-10-18 17:51:34
 |- Original fields:
	['Common name', 'Scientific name', 'Location', 'Temperament', 'Diet', 'Water', 'Size', 'Region of the Aquarium', 'Breeding']
 |- Generate mapfile	mapfiles/fishproject-oai_dc.csv
Target field for Common name : dc:identifier
Target field for Scientific name : dc:title
Target field for Location : dcterms:spatial
Target field for Temperament : dc:type
Target field for Diet : dcterms:requires
Target field for Water : dcterms:medium
Target field for Size : dcterms:extent
Target field for Region of the Aquarium : dcterms:provenance
Target field for Breeding : dcterms:created
 |- Generate XML files in oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/sample_1/xml
  |--> Compressiceps.xml
  |--> Frontosa.xml
  |--> GoldenJulie.xml
  |--> ConvictJulie.xml
  |--> PrincessCichlid.xml
  |--> Cylindricus.xml
  |--> Multi.xml
  |--> FiveBarCichlid.xml
```

This results not only in the newly generated mapping file ```fishproject-oai_dc.csv```, but as well the mapping is excecuted and the associated XML files are written to the output directory ```oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/sample_1/xml/```.

### Excercise 2.1: Configure your own mapping

Repeat the generation and do your own mapping by adapting the mapping rules in the mapfile to your needs. Hereby the seperator ```>``` is used to seperate the original field name and the target Dublincore element or term :
```sh
$ vi mapfiles/fishproject-oai_dc.csv
Common name>dc:identifier
Scientific name>dc:title
Location>dcterms:spatial
Temperament>dc:type
Diet>dcterms:requires
Water>dcterms:medium
Size>dcterms:extent
Region of the Aquarium>dcterms:provenance
Breeding>dcterms:created
```
 
### Excercise 2.2: Check and validate XML file

Check the results, i.e. the generated XML files in the output directory ```oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/sample_1/xml/```. E.g. with the above mapping one of the resulted files looks as follows:

```sh  
less oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/sample_1/xml/Compressiceps.xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<metadata
    xmlns="http://example.org/myapp/"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">

        <dc:identifier>Compressiceps</dc:identifier>
        <dc:title>Haplochromis compressiceps</dc:title>
        <dc:type>Territorial</dc:type>
        <dcterms:created>Hard</dcterms:created>
        <dcterms:extent>5 inches</dcterms:extent>
        <dcterms:medium>PH 7.0 - 8.0, Temp. 73 - 77 F</dcterms:medium>
        <dcterms:provenance>Bottom</dcterms:provenance>
        <dcterms:requires>Omnivore</dcterms:requires>
        <dcterms:spatial>Lake Tanganyika</dcterms:spatial>
</metadata>
```

You can check this e.g. by one of the available XML validators, e.g. ```sh http://www.xmlvalidation.com/```.

> Note : Here starts the issue of semantic mapping and 
> homogenisation of a research specific vocabulary to a common, 
> restricted vocabulary or schema as DublinCore. I.e. the mapping above is quite "formal", e.g. `Diet` is mapped to `dcterms:requires`, but likely the intention of the DublinCore consortium by introducing the field `requires` was not in the sense of `a plant requires a specific diet`. So, if we want to cover these specific biological properties we have to add another extented shema, which covers the property `Diet`.

# Generation of metadata
This document describes how formated metadata records can be generated from given raw information. 

## Environment
Ubuntu 14.04 server

## Prerequisites

### 1. Python and the convert script
* Python 2.7 or later

#### 1.1. The script mdmanger.py
The python script ```mdmanger.py (mode ‘g’)``` is used for this training module and comes already with the training package.

#### 1.2
The needed pyton module *dublincore* can be installed by
```sh
pip install dublincore
```
> Note : If you get an error like
```sh
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): dublincore in /home/xxx/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages
```
> you have to add this path to your Python path by
```sh
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/k204019/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/
```

### 2. Some samples of raw data
Some examples of 'raw metadata', i.e. comma and tabulator seperated lists,are given in the directory *samples/RAW_data*.
```sh
ls samples/RAW_data
annotations.tsv  sample.csv  smallData.tsv
```
At the moment this part ist tested with the comma separated list in ```sample.csv```.

## Usage

### 1. Generation of DublinCore XML files

Please check first the usage of the script by :
```sh
./mdmanager.py -h
```
For this part we will only use the `Single Mode Options`
```sh
Use these options if you want to ingest from only ONE source.

--source=PATH, -s PATH  A URL to .xml files which you want to harvest
--verb=STRING           Verbs or requests defined in OAI-PMH, can be
                        ListRecords (default) or ListIdentifers here
--mdsubset=STRING       Subset of harvested meta data
--mdprefix=STRING       Prefix of harvested meta data
--target_mdschema=STRING
                        Meta data schema of the target
```

In the following we show how you can convert comma or tabular seperated lists of values to valid XML files formated in the [DublinCore](http://dublincore.org/) metadata schema. The usage of the several options mentioned above will explained in the following.

#### 1.2. Creation of a mapfile
In a first step we define the mapping of each field in the header line of the sample file
```sh
$ head -1 samples/RAW_data/sample.csv 
Common name,Scientific name,Location,Temperament,Diet,Water,Size,Region of the Aquarium,Breeding
```
to one of the DublinCore elements (see ```sh mapfiles/dcelements.txt```) or the DublinCore terms (see ```sh mapfiles/dcterms.txt```).

You are free by assigning the original fields to any one of the dublincore fields. The only mandatory fields to set are ```dc:title``` and ```dc:identifier```, whereby the value of the latter is used to build the filename of the generated XML record. 

Beside the mode (`--mode g`, standing for genaration) and the source (`-s FILE`), i.e. the path to the csv file, the following options are mandatory :
- ```-c COMMUNITY``` : a free choosen project or community name. Here and in the following modules we call our project *fishproject*.
- ```--mdprefix MDFORMAT``` : This is the target metadata schema, we choose here *oai_dc*, i.e. the Dublincore metadata schema.
- ```--mdsubset MDSUBSET``` : The subset that determines the sub directory the generated XML files reside.
- ```--verb DELIMITER``` : specifies the delimiter by which the sample data are seperated, in our example *comma*.

From the first two parameters the name for the mapfile (as well a cvs file) is built as ```mapfiles/<community>-<mdprefix>.csv``` and from the first three the output path is combind to ```oaidata/<community>-<mdprefix>/<mdsubset>_1```.  

By calling the script with the csv file as source for the first time, there will be no mapfile available. So you are asked for each original header field to enter a valid DublinCore element or term :

```sh
./mdmanager.py --mode g -s samples/RAW_data/sample.csv -c fishproject --mdprefix oai_dc --mdsubset sample --verb comma

Target field for Common name : dc:identifier
Target field for Scientific name : dc:title
Target field for Location : dcterms:spatial
Target field for Temperament : dc:type
Target field for Diet : dcterms:requires
Target field for Water : dcterms:medium
Target field for Size : dcterms:extent
Target field for Region of the Aquarium : dcterms:provenance
Target field for Breeding : dcterms:created
```

This results not only in the newly generated mapping file ```fishproject-oai_dc.csv```, but as well the mapping is excecuted and the associated XML files are written to the output directory ```oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/sample_1/xml/```.

#### Excercise 2.1: Repeat the generation and do your own mapping by adapting the mapping rules in teh mapfile to your needs. Hereby the seperator ´´´>´´´ is used to seperate the original field name and the target Dublincore element or term :
```sh
$ vi mapfiles/fishproject-oai_dc.csv
ommon name>dc:identifier
Scientific name>dc:title
Location>dcterms:spatial
Temperament> dc:type
Diet>dcterms:requires
Water>
Size> dcterms:extent
Region of the Aquarium>dcterms:provenance
Breeding>dcterms:created
```
 
#### Excercise 2.2: Check the results, i.e. the generated XML files in the output directory,e.g. with the above mapping one of the resulted files looks as follows:

```sh  
less myout/Compressiceps-DC.xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<metadata
    xmlns="http://example.org/myapp/"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">

        <dc:identifier>Compressiceps</dc:identifier>
        <dc:title>Haplochromis compressiceps</dc:title>
        <dc:type>Territorial</dc:type>
        <dcterms:created>Hard</dcterms:created>
        <dcterms:extent>5 inches</dcterms:extent>
        <dcterms:provenance>Bottom</dcterms:provenance>
        <dcterms:requires>Omnivore</dcterms:requires>
        <dcterms:spatial>Lake Tanganyika</dcterms:spatial>
</metadata>
``` 
You can check this e.g. by one of the available XML validators, e.g. ```sh http://www.xmlvalidation.com/```.

> Note : Here starts the issue of semantic mapping and 
> homogenisation of a research specific vocabulary to a common, 
> restricted vocabulary or schema as DublinCore. I.e. the mapping above is quite "formal", e.g. `Diet` is mapped to `dcterms:requires`, but likely the intention of the DublinCore consortium by introducing the field `requires` was not in the sense of `a plant requires a specific diet`. So, if we want to cover these specific biological properties we have to add another extented shema, which covers the property `Diet`.

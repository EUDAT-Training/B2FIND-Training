# Generation of metadata
Given some metadata as spreadsheet we need to convert this metadata to valid xml files that is conform with the Dublin Core specifications which will be mapped to facets in B2FIND.
This document describes how to generate such formatted metadata records from spreadsheet (comma and tab-separated) files. 

## Prerequisites

### 1. Usage of the Python script in mode *Generation*
All functionality to convert spreadsheet data into well-formatted xml files is provided by the script [mdmanager.py](mdmanager.py) that we will use in this part of the tutorial in processing *g*, i.e. with the otption `--mode g` and by specifying a source file (the raw spreadsheet) by the option `-s SOURCE`. 
The usage and dependancies is described in detail in the associated paragraph in [00.mdmanager-script.md](00.mdmanager-script.md#modeGeneration). 

### 2. Usecases : Some samples of raw data
Some examples of 'raw metadata', i.e. comma and tabulator seperated lists, are given in the directory *samples/RAW_data*.
```sh
ls samples/RAW_data
annotations.tsv  locations.tsv  sample.csv  smallData.tsv
```
At the moment this part is fully tested with the comma separated lists in the file ```sample.csv```.

In the following we show how you can convert comma or tabular seperated files to valid XML files formated in the [DublinCore](http://dublincore.org/) metadata schema. The usage of the several options mentioned above will be explained in the following.

### 1.2. Creation of a mapfile
In a first step we define the mapping of each field in the header line of the sample file
```sh
$ head -1 samples/RAW_data/sample.csv 
Common name,Scientific name,Location,Temperament,Diet,Water,Size,Region of the Aquarium,Breeding
```
to one of the DublinCore elements (see ```mapfiles/dcelements.txt```) or the DublinCore terms (see ```mapfiles/dcterms.txt```).

You are free by assigning the original fields to any one of the DublinCore fields. The only mandatory fields to set are ```dc:title``` and ```dc:identifier```, whereby the value of the latter is used to build the filename of the generated XML record. 

Beside the mode (`--mode g`, standing for generation) and the source (`-s FILE`, the path to the csv file) you have to choose a name for the project with the `community` option :
```--community=STRING, -c STRING
                        community or project, where data harvested from and
                        uploaded to. This 'label' is used through the whole
                        metadata life cycle or workflow.
``` 
Here and in the following modules we call our project *fishproject*.

For the delimiter we use the default 'comma', because the source is in this case a 'comma separated value (csv)' file.

Optionally you can set the metadata schema the generated XML files should be formatted (we choose here the default `oai_dc` standing for *DublinCore*) and the subset rsp. subdirectory, where to save the files by the options listed under 'Harvest Options' :
```
--mdsubset=STRING       (Optional) Subset of harvested meta data
--mdprefix=STRING       Metadata format and schema of harvested meta data
                        (default is the OAI mdprefix 'oai_dc'
```
From these parameters the name for the mapfile is built as ```mapfiles/<community>-<mdprefix>.csv``` and the output path is combined to ```oaidata/<community>-<mdprefix>/<mdsubset>_1``` (if <mdsubset> is not explicitly given files are written to sub directory SET_1).  

When calling the script for the first time for this use case you are asked to define the mapping from column names in the spreadsheet to Dublin Core fields:

```sh
./mdmanager.py --mode g -c fishproject -s samples/RAW_data/sample.csv [--mdprefix oai_dc] [--mdsubset sample] [--verb comma]
...

Target field for Water : dcterms:medium

Target field for Region of the Aquarium : dcterms:provenance
Target field for Breeding : dcterms:created
 |- Generate XML files in oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/sample_1/xml

  |--> Frontosa.xml
  |--> GoldenJulie.xml
  |--> ConvictJulie.xml
  |--> PrincessCichlid.xml
  |--> Cylindricus.xml
  |--> Multi.xml
  |--> FiveBarCichlid.xml
```
**Note**, the communities name is given as *fishproject*. In all subsequent steps, the community name should not be changed. It denotes the owner of  the data and is used to tie all subsequent steps together.
This command does not only generate the mapping file ```fishproject-oai_dc.csv```, but the mapping is excecuted and the associated XML files are written to the output directory ```oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/sample_1/xml/```.

### Excercise 2.1: Configure your own mapping

Repeat the generation and do your own mapping by adapting the mapping rules in the mapfile to your needs. Hereby the seperator ```>``` is used to seperate the original field name and the target Dublincore element or term :
```sh
$ vi mapfiles/fishproject-oai_dc.csv
Common name>dc:identifier
Scientific name>dc:title
Location>dcterms:spatial
Temperament>dc:type
Diet>dcterms:requires
Water>dcterms:medium
Size>dcterms:extent
Region of the Aquarium>dcterms:provenance
Breeding>dcterms:created
```
 
### Excercise 2.2: Check and validate XML file

Check the results, i.e. the generated XML files in the output directory ```oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/sample_1/xml/```. E.g. with the above mapping one of the resulted files looks as follows:

```sh  
less oaidata/fishproject-oai_dc/sample_1/xml/Compressiceps.xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<metadata
    xmlns="http://example.org/myapp/"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"
    xmlns:dcterms="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">

        <dc:identifier>Compressiceps</dc:identifier>
        <dc:title>Haplochromis compressiceps</dc:title>
        <dc:type>Territorial</dc:type>
        <dcterms:created>Hard</dcterms:created>
        <dcterms:extent>5 inches</dcterms:extent>
        <dcterms:medium>PH 7.0 - 8.0, Temp. 73 - 77 F</dcterms:medium>
        <dcterms:provenance>Bottom</dcterms:provenance>
        <dcterms:requires>Omnivore</dcterms:requires>
        <dcterms:spatial>Lake Tanganyika</dcterms:spatial>
</metadata>
```

You can check this e.g. by one of the available XML validators, e.g. ```sh http://www.xmlvalidation.com/```.

> Note: Here starts the issue of semantic mapping and 
> homogenisation of a research-specific vocabulary to a common, 
> restricted vocabulary or schema as DublinCore. I.e. the mapping above is quite "formal", e.g. `Diet` is mapped to `dcterms:requires`, but likely the intention of the DublinCore consortium by introducing the field `requires` was not in the sense of `a plant requires a specific diet`. So, if we want to cover these specific biological properties we have to add another extented shema, which covers the property `Diet`.
